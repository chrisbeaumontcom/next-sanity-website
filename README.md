# CB Website Next JS

A simple artwork showcase site with a contact form.

It is a new [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) version of the previous [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) site that I built in 2020.

I set this one up from scratch this time using the same Sanity Studio setup from the Gatsby version.

I built the first Next JS version with a Prismic CMS back in 2019. The world has changed a bit since then.
